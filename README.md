# R&R Carpentry and Building Limited Website

This is a fast, no-monthly-fee static website designed for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository (recommended name: `rrcarpentryandbuilding`).
3. Upload all files from this folder to the repository root.
4. In the repository: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / **(root)**
5. Save. Your site will appear at a GitHub Pages URL.

## Update the gallery photos

Replace the placeholder files in `assets/gallery/` with your own photos.
- Easiest: use JPGs named `photo-01.jpg`, `photo-02.jpg`, etc.
- Then update `gallery.html` to point to the JPG files (search for `photo-01` etc).

## Contact form

The contact form uses a "mailto:" approach (no backend, no monthly fees).
If you want a true submit form later, we can add a free form endpoint (still static hosting).
